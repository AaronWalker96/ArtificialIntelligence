Notes form the logging front

- We can do logging by three ways
	- Outputting to the terminal
	- Drawing to in model graphs
	- Dumping to CSV for later / more advnaced statistical analysis & processing

- Review of each method
	- Outputting to the terminal
		- Good for quick debugging
		- Messy for actual logging, not recommended
	- Drawing to graphs
		- Plug in really well ot Nlogo (almost like they were designed to)
		- Great for real time runtime feedback
		- Not permanent, data cannot be easily pulled out after fact and saved
	- Dumping to CSV
		- Perminent, written to file outside the model
		- Logs need rotating else you write multiple runs to same file
		- Requires third party processing to gain additional info
		- Third party processing may be less painless than in netlogo processing

- Improvements to logging
	- It _may_ be possible to have the logger feed in model graphs, kill two birds w' one stone (if this can be done then I am confident it can be done wo' damaging decoupling)
	- It _may_ be possible to timestamp and rotate the files in netlogo on clear command

- Bigger questions
	- Do these efforts into logging help aid the project
	- Is it a waste of time to be doing our own logging or will it pay off in the long run and save us future pain
	- What sort of data processing are we planning on doing on the mal model
	- How will the captured data from the mal model help us understand the internal workins
	- How well will the captured data help us answer the question?
